# Text-File-Analysis

## What it is
This script parses a text file and gives statistics on the file's words. 
The analysis provided covers the following:
* Number of words
* shortest/longest word
* number of palindromes

## How it works
To use this script, you simply need to change the file name (line 8) that the script needs to look for 
> When first downloaded, line 8 should read something like:
> `with  open("GreatGatsby.txt","r")`

The script and the desired text file needs to be saved in the the same directory folder. 

Please find a video of the script being implemented here:
